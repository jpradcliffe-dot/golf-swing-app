# Golf Swing Analyzer (Next.js + MoveNet)

## Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` to run locally
3. Push to Vercel for deployment.

## Notes
- All TensorFlow code runs in browser (client components).
- Use Chrome/Edge for best WebGL support.
- If deployment fails due to dependency resolution in CI, run `npm ci` locally to reproduce.
